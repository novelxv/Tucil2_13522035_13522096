## Description
This program is designed to animate the process of forming Bézier curves using a divide and conquer based midpoint algorithm. By inputting a set of control points, the program will progressively display the curve formation from these points through a series of iterations.

## Requirements and Installation
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib

### Installing Matplotlib
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to Run
To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the program file is saved
```
cd src
```
then execute the command
```
python main.py
```
Follow the instructions in the program to enter control points and the number of iterations.
